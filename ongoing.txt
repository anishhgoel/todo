first I initalize a npm init -y then make a server.js with basic server code and install dependencies mongoose and express

Now configure mongoose:
first import mongoose library
then connect to mongoose library. remember we need to initailize an express server first and then connect to mongoose.


now i will create the model for mongoose

now its time for the routes

Made get route. FOr api, its best to name route preceeded by api. something like /api/todos

Making post route.
Rememeber as we change location, api address changes. SO sometimes mongo db won't work as with change of location, monogodb will throw error
that we are trying to access databse from a location which is not whitelisted. We can change the security options in mongodb but it is not preferred for production.'
This is called whitelisting. Its an extra security layer, even when username and password are compromised.
